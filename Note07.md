# Storage

Storage allows users to preserve, save and archive their data in the cloud. However, in storage we have what hardware is, which are hard drives, solid state drives (SSD), storage drive capacity, volatile and non-volatile storage, RAM, optical drives and flash drives.

# Storage Hardware
They are pieces that are used to store data either for each desktop computer or laptop. tablets and cellphone.

In a computer, there are two types of storage: 
Volatile: is a type of storage whose contents are erased when the system's power is turned off or interrupted.
Non-Volatile: is a term used to describe any memory or storage that is saved regardless of the power to the computer is on or off. 
It is also called persistent storage or permanent storage.

# Disaster Recovery and Technology
In a company, data is valuable where it must be accessed easily and securely, protecting its data, which must be
to make decisions about how they will access the files, back them up, and also make backup copies to avoid having
lost either by a disaster or by other means that compromise decisions in the storage infrastructure.

Disaster Recovery
Based on a disaster that puts the company at risk due to a natural disaster, equipment failure or cyber attack
Storage are key areas to carefully plan your recovery without any problem.

Fault Tolerance

Note that failures may be unintentional, either due to a crash in the system, cable or hardware, while if
This is intentional because it is an unreliable system and looks for a way to access the data and can make the system inoperable.

Replication
Replication of IT infrastructure and data means that you have a full working duplicate of the data, systems, and networks that are critical.

Redundancy
Redundancy is the idea where you have IT infrastructure in place to keep a business running, but it may be at a reduced capacity. 

# Storage in the Enterprise

A single disk is enough for a computer to run the system and save its data, but a single disk for
business would not be enough since these companies have hundreds and thousands of employees which require IT solutions of
intensive use, and a storage solution that allows you to make backup copies and store data.
#  Storage in the Cloud

Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages 
and operates data storage as a service. It is also low demand with just-in-time capacity and costs which eliminates the need to purchase and manage your own data storage infrastructure, which gives you agility, global scale and durability
where you can access data wherever you want at the time you want.

# Types of Cloud Storage

Object Storage:Object storage solutions are ideal for building modern applications from scratch that require scale and flexibility, 
and can also be used to import existing data stores for analytics, backup, or archive.

File Storage:  Some applications need to access shared files and require a file system. This type of storage is often supported
with a Network Attached Storage (NAS) server.

Block Storage: Block-based cloud storage solutions are provisioned with each virtual server and offer the ultra low latency
required for high performance workloads.

In this module I learned about storage, what types of storage there are, how we should save files and prevent them from being lost due to a disaster or any other means, and how to 
use storage services such as Amazon S3 Glacier, EFS, among others, AWS.

What will happen if the hard drive is damaged and you did not make any backup and you want to recover important information, this would be completely lost?
